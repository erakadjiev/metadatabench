/**
 * A directory creation strategy that selects a parent directory from the existing set of directories 
 * using the Barabasi-Albert algorithm (see 
 * <a href="http://www3.nd.edu/~networks/Publication%20Categories/03%20Journal%20Articles/Physics/EmergenceRandom_Science%20286,%20509-512%20%281999%29.pdf">here</a> 
 * or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barabasiâ€“Albert_model">here</a>).
 * The BA algorithm is used to generate scale-free (degree distribution follow a power law) random graphs. In 
 * each step, a new node is added using preferential attachment, that is the probability of selecting an existing 
 * node as the parent of the new one is proportional to the number of links (compared to the total number of links) 
 * that the existing node has.
 * Because the straightforward implementation of the BA algorithm is expensive, an optimized version is implemented here. 
 * In each step, an existing node (directory) is selected using a uniform distribution. Then either the selected 
 * node itself or its parent is selected (with equal probability) as the parent of the node to be created.
